# Privacy Policy – Json Codable

_Last updated: 10 Dec 2025_

(Json Codable is a macOS application that helps developers convert JSON into Swift `Codable` models.)

This Privacy Policy explains how Json Codable (“the App”, “we”, “our”) handles your data.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

Json Codable **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers**.

All data you use in the App, including but not limited to:

- JSON you paste, type, or import
- Generated Swift code
- Saved history snippets

is processed **locally on your device only**.

We do **not**:

- Use analytics SDKs  
- Use third-party tracking  
- Send any of your JSON, code, or usage data to a remote server  

---

## 2. Local Storage

The App may store the following data **locally on your Mac**:

- JSON snippets you explicitly choose to save to history  
- Metadata such as snippet name and creation date  
- App preferences and settings (e.g. root type name, chosen options)  

This data is stored using Apple’s local storage technologies (such as SwiftData and the app’s local container).

You remain in full control of this data. You can remove it at any time by:

- Using the **Clear history** option inside the App (to delete stored snippets), and/or  
- Deleting the App from your Mac, which removes its local data container  

We (the developer) do not have access to any of this locally stored data.

---

## 3. Imported Files

When you use the **Import JSON** feature:

- The App reads the contents of the file you select  
- The content is displayed in the JSON editor  
- The file contents are **not** uploaded or transmitted anywhere  

All file access happens locally on your device and solely for the purpose of helping you generate Swift models.

---

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Json Codable is a developer tool aimed at software engineers and technical users.  
It is **not designed or marketed for children** or general consumer use.

Because the App does not send data to any server, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Json Codable does **not** integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

- No analytics events are sent from within the App  
- No ads or tracking libraries are embedded in the App  

---

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:

- Changes in the App’s features or behavior, or  
- Updates to legal and regulatory requirements  

When we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.

If you continue to use the App after a change, you agree to the updated Privacy Policy.
